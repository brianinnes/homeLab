# OKD Technical Documentation

This section of the documentation is for developers that want to customize OKD.

The section will cover:

- How is OKD delivered
- How to build an OKD operator
- How to deploy a self-build version of an OKD operator to an existing cluster
- How to create a customized OKD installer containing your self-built operator

The above section will allow you to work on fixes and enhancements to core OKD operators and be able to run them locally.

In addition to the above this section will also look at the Red Hat build and test setup, looking at how OpenShift and OKD operators are built and tested and how releases are created.
