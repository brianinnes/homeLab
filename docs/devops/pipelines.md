# Pipelines

<!--- cSpell:ignore  tekton -->

Tekton is the upstream project for OpenShift Pipelines.  

The upstream project includes the integration with the OpenShift and OKD consoles, however the upstream project doesn't include the cluster wide tasks that are included in the OpenShift Pipelines operator.

## Installing Tekton

The OpenShift operator is not available in the community hub, but the [Tekton site](https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/install/#installing-tekton-pipelines-on-openshift) includes install instructions for Tekton

## Tekton Hub

There is a [community hub](https://hub.tekton.dev/){: target=_blank} of tasks available, which is the source of the content installed by the OpenShift Pipelines operator.  The hub allows you to search for tasks then provides the command to install the task to your cluster.
